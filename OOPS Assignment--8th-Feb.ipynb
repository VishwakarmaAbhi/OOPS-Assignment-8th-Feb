    "The \"abc\" module is used for the following purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Defining Abstract Base Classes (ABCs):\n",
    "\n",
    "* Abstract Base Classes are classes that cannot be instantiated directly but serve as a blueprint for other classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "* They define a set of methods that must be implemented by subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ABCs are useful for creating a common interface or protocol that multiple subclasses can adhere to, ensuring consistent behavior across different implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Defining Abstract Methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Abstract methods are methods declared within an abstract base class that must be implemented by concrete subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "* They provide a way to define a contract or interface that subclasses must adhere to.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If a subclass fails to implement one or more abstract methods defined in its base class, it will raise an error at runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Enforcing Polymorphism:\n",
    "* Abstract base classes help enforce polymorphism by providing a common interface for different types of objects.\n",

It helps promote code reusability, maintainability, and readability by providing a clear contract between classes and ensuring consistent behavior across implementations."
